					The Hub is the primary way to install the Unity Editor, create
					projects, and manage your Unity experience. It provides a central
					location to manage your Editor installations, Accounts and Licenses,
					and Projects. For more information, see Installing Unity using the
					Hub.
				</p>
				<h2 class="subtitle">-Other installation options</h2>
				<ul class="list">
					<li>
						<p>
							You can use the command line to install the Editor. If you
							subsequently choose to install the Hub, you can add it to the Hub
							at that time. For more information, see Installing Unity from the
							command line.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							You can install Unity offline without using the Hub. This allows
							you to download all the necessary files for installing Unity, and
							generate a script to install the Editor on computers without
							internet access. For more information, see Installing Unity
							offline without the Hub.

					If you start the Unity Editor without the Hub installed, Unity prompts
					you to install it. If you have a license from a previous version of
					Unity, you can create an empty project from the Hub installation
					prompt. If you subsequently try to create or open a project from
					within the Unity Editor, Unity prompts install the Hub.

							displays the Editor version that the project should use.
						</p>

					<li>

							Click the drop-down arrow next to the New button to select the
							Editor version that you want to use. Note: This drop-down menu is

							(A) The Toolbar provides access to the most essential working
							features. On the left it contains the basic tools for manipulating
							the Scene view and the GameObjects within it.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							(B) The Hierarchy window is a hierarchical text representation of
							every GameObject in the Scene . Each item in the Scene has an
							entry in the hierarchy, so the two windows are inherently linked.
							The hierarchy reveals the structure of how GameObjects attach to
							each another.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							(C) The Game view simulates what your final rendered game will
							look like through your Scene Cameras . When you click the Play
							button, the simulation begins.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							(D) The Scene view allows you to visually navigate and edit your
							Scene. The Scene view can show a 3D or 2D perspective, depending
							on the type of Project you are working on.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							(E) The Inspector Window allows you to view and edit all the
							properties of the currently selected GameObject. Because different
							types of GameObjects have different sets of properties, the layout
							and contents of the Inspector window change each time you select a
							different GameObject.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							(F) The Project window displays your library of Assets that are
							available to use in your Project. When you import Assets into your
							Project, they appear here.
